/**
 * Asks the connected devices for a data sync before an upload runs.
 *
 * Why this exists: many devices (Huawei/Honor bands in particular) do not push
 * their recorded data on their own — the phone has to request it. Without a
 * request, Gadgetbridge's local database stays empty and the webhook upload
 * would happily upload nothing. Triggering the fetch first means the upload
 * that follows ([WebhookScheduler.scheduleImmediate] is called by
 * [nodomain.freeyourgadget.gadgetbridge.util.GB.signalActivityDataFinish] when
 * the sync finishes) carries fresh data.
 *
 * The request is throttled by [WebhookConfig.PRE_SYNC_MIN_INTERVAL_MS] so we do
 * not keep the BLE link (and the band's battery) busy, and it is skipped for
 * devices that are not connected or currently busy with another operation.
